-- #19 clubs (owner, Oct 14): "Clubs and lounges should be open space. If a club has a rest room, it
-- should be on another floor. And the restroom could be a place where gossip is shared." "VIP lounge
-- should also be another floor and accessible to only people with a certain amount of clout or very
-- expensive." "More clubs with some cheap clubs, some medium clubs and some exclusive clubs." Gossip
-- "should happen in both, but juicier gossip in the restroom."
--   * The city seed gains places.club (a restroom floor; vip "medium" or "exclusive"; doorClout),
--     economy.clubs (VIP free from freeClout, otherwise a cover for the New York day; vipTimes),
--     economy.gossip.restroom, and three clubs with a night each: The Sticky Floor and Discount
--     Disco (cheap), Ultraviolet Society (exclusive: 2,000 clout at the door).
--   * travel refuses a club whose door rule the player doesn't meet ('door_clout'), so nothing at that
--     club (visits, events, the bar, gossip, VIP) can happen without it; ensure_daily never sets a task there.
--   * enter_vip: the VIP floor, free from the club's freeClout, else the cover once per New York day
--     (ledger cash 'vip_cover', ref place:day), paid only when p_pay is true.
--   * vip_seen: "Get seen in VIP", once a day per club: vipTimes the clout of getting seen downstairs
--     (ledger clout 'vip', ref place:day), with the visit's Mood, Confidence and Energy.
--   * Gossip pieces gain the source 'restroom'; gossip_find(place, 'restroom') hears those and the
--     overheard ones, and a restroom piece pays gossip.restroom clout and Mood on the spot (ledger
--     clout 'gossip_restroom', ref story:piece).
